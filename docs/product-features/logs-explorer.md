## Introduction

The Logs Explorer page in SigNoz enables developers to filter, examine, and analyze logs. There are two ways to filter the logs and each way has 3 different views available in Logs Explorer which include:

- [List View](#list-view)
- [Time Series View](#time-series-view)
- [Table View](#table-view)


## Using Search

The search feature in Logs Explorer allows you to filter your logs data using different attributes (like `serviceName`, `status` etc.) using an operator (like `IN`, `=` etc.). You can filter using multiple attributes simultaneously.
